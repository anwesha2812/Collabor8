Follow these steps to install Android Studio on Linux:

(1) Unpack the.zip file you downloaded to a location suitable for your apps, such as /opt for shared users or /usr/local/ for your user profile.
Install the necessary libraries for 64-bit computers first if you're running a 64-bit version of Linux.

(2) Open a terminal, go to the android-studio/bin/ directory, and run studio.sh to start Android Studio.

(3) Make your choice on importing old Android Studio settings, then click OK.

(4) The Android Studio Setup Wizard walks you through the remaining setup steps, including downloading the necessary parts of the Android SDK for development.


Follow these steps to install Android Studio on Windows:

(1) Double-click an.exe file you downloaded to run it (recommended).
If a.zip file was downloaded, unzip it, copy the android-studio folder into your Program Files folder, enter the android-studio > bin folder, and then run studio64.exe (for 64-bit computers) or studio.exe (for 32-bit machines).

(2) Install any SDK packages that are suggested by Android Studio's setup process.
